All you need are cutting shears and a bucket," said Gros. </p><p>"With 40 thieves cutting, it can go very quickly!"  </p><p>Sometimes the loss is accidental -- contractors have been known to harvest the wrong tract of land. </p><p>At the start of the harvest in the Cote d'Or, under a brilliant sun, seasonal workers are carefully prising loose the precious fruit that will yield the next vintage. </p><p>They stop occasionally to wave at two policemen zipping past on bikes.</p><p>Two more use offroad motorcycles for their surveillance, while after sunset, a team of three patrollers drive around by car and peer into the dark with night-vision goggles. </p><p></p><p></p><p>"When we spot people who have no business in the vineyards at night, we turn a spotlight on them.... and we question them," said a patrolling officer who identified himself only as Philippe.</p><p>"The thefts mostly happen at night... and in the early morning hours. Sometimes the thieves are many, and using harvesting machines." </p><p>The patrols were started in the Burgundy region, whose unique wine-growing tradition has been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage list, after a poor harvest in 2016 that was aggravated by a rise in theft.</p><p>According to Cote d'Or police department, stealing grapes is punishable by up to three years in prison and a fine of 45,000 euros (almost $50,999). </p><p>"Grape theft is not only a crime but also directly affects the economy of the region and its wine sector already heavily affected by climate hazards," the department stressed on its Facebook page.</p><p>cha/mlr/sjw/dl</p><p></p><p class="credit">AFP</p></xmlText><xmlFormatRef><keyVal>XHTML</keyVal></xmlFormatRef></story></xml></log>
