The player who commits the fewest errors, bid after bid and play after play, usually comes out on top.</t:p><t:p>Today's hand is one on which many declarers would fail to make three notrump. This outcome, however, would be directly attributable to an error rather than bad luck or good defensive play.</t:p><t:p>The opening heart lead is taken by the king, and the question is whether South, who needs to develop four more tricks, should first attack spades, diamonds or clubs.</t:p><t:p>Diamonds should be dismissed outright because the suit lacks body and, more importantly, success would not be guaranteed even if the missing diamonds were divided 3-3.</t:p><t:p>In contrast, clubs and spades are certain to provide enough tricks for the contract, even if declarer loses the finesse in clubs. All South has to do is to make sure that the opponents don't score five tricks before he has taken nine.</t:p><t:p>The sole threat is that West has five or more hearts and might eventually gain the lead to run the suit. But the only way West could gain the lead would be with the ace of spades. West should therefore be deprived of that potential entry while South still has a second heart stopper, so spades should be attacked immediately.</t:p><t:p>In the actual case, West takes the first or second spade and returns a heart, ducked by declarer. A third heart is won by the ace, and the club finesse is then attempted. East wins, but since he cannot reach West's good hearts, the contract is home with an overtrick.</t:p><t:p>Note that if declarer attempts the club finesse first, East takes the king and dislodges South's last heart stopper. When declarer eventually leads a spade to try to develop the game-going tricks, West wins with the ace and cashes his remaining hearts to score a one-trick set.</t:p><t:p>Tomorrow: A neat swindle.</t:p><t:p>(c)2019 King Features Syndicate Inc.</t:p><t:p /><t:p /></t:t></tText></article></body></txts></article><txtGeometry name="0f49d4fd-1e66-49b6-b1a0-ed57ba38f80d"><txtRef objectType="body"><keyRef objectType="folder"><keyVal>/HR/Production/In_Progress</keyVal></keyRef><keyVal>20191112</keyVal></txtRef><regionRef objectType="region"><keyRef objectType="title"><keyVal>HR</keyVal></keyRef><keyVal>Print</keyVal></regionRef><folderRef objectType="folder"><keyVal>/HR/Production/In_Progress</keyVal></folderRef><contextRef objectType="justContext"><keyRef objectType="justScope"><keyVal>HR</keyVal></keyRef><keyVal>vanillabody</keyVal></contextRef><data /><localGeometry /><jumps /></txtGeometry></objects></xml></log>
