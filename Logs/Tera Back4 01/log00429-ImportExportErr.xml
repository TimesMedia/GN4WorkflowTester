I don't think we should apologise also for seeking to advance our exit from the European Union," Gove told the BBC.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The ruling throws Johnson's Brexit planning into disarray, coming after a series of defeats in parliament that have curbed his plans to push ahead with Brexit even if there is no divorce deal with Brussels.</p><p>Johnson told British media he "strongly disagreed" with the court decision but would respect it.</p><p>The prime minister is likely to also renew his call for an early election to end the stand-off with parliament, having said in New York on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly on Tuesday that it was "the obvious thing to do".</p><p>Despite the series of hammer blows in the House of Commons and the courts, as well as losing his parliamentary majority, Johnson is still riding high in the polls and keen for an election to try and win enough seats to push through Brexit.</p><p>But he requires the consent of opposition parties to hold a snap election and they are so far reluctant, preferring to use their working majority to keep a tight leash on Johnson as the EU departure deadline of October 31 looms.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The 11 Supreme Court judges ruled on Tuesday that the parliamentary suspension, which came into effect this month, was "unlawful, void and of no effect".</p><p>Johnson had argued that shutting down parliament until October 14 was a routine move to allow his new government to set out a new legislative programme.</p><p>But critics accused him of trying to silence MPs.</p><p>Johnson is likely to resist resignation calls, insisting that he must take Britain out of the EU next month whatever the circumstances.</p><p>In the week between returning from their summer holiday and prorogation on September 10, MPs passed a law aiming to stop "no deal".</p><p>It obliges Johnson to ask Brussels to delay Brexit by three months if he has not agreed a divorce deal at an EU summit on October 17 and 18.</p><p>The prime minister has said he would rather "be dead in a ditch" than ask for another extension, setting up a potential showdown.</p><p>Johnson said Tuesday that he hoped to amend the divorce deal struck between the EU and his predecessor Theresa May, which has been rejected by MPs three times.</p><p>dt/jwp/rlp</p><p></p><p class="credit">AFP</p></xmlText><xmlFormatRef><keyVal>XHTML</keyVal></xmlFormatRef></story></xml></log>
