William Bain Jr. was 80.</p><p xmlns="">Bain died at his home in Naples, Florida, on Tuesday, according to his obituary. No cause of death was given.</p><p xmlns="">He founded Bain &amp; Co., a corporate strategy consulting firm in 1973, and in 1984 founded the private equity firm Bain Capital.</p><p xmlns="">"Bill's enduring influence is as vibrant today as when he and a few colleagues first took the leap to start Bain &amp; Company 45 years ago," Bain &amp; Co. said in a statement Thursday. "His focus on client results over just good recommendations was revolutionary at the time. His vision of a more productive client relationship was profound, and he understood deeply the power of a community of extraordinary teams."</p><p xmlns="">Romney served as Bain Capital's chief executive.</p><p xmlns="">"It's hard for me to imagine my life and career without Bill Bain's mentoring,'" Romney said in a statement to The Boston Globe. "He hired me, taught me and gave me the opportunity of a lifetime. His vision and confidence made Bain Capital possible."</p><p xmlns="">Bain was born in Johnson City, Tennessee, and attended East Tennessee State College for two years before transferring to Vanderbilt University, graduating in 1959 with a degree in history.</p><p xmlns="">He joined the Vanderbilt development office, eventually becoming the school's director of development, where he caught the eye of Bruce Henderson, a Vanderbilt alumnus and founder of the Boston Consulting Group. Henderson recognized Bain's talent despite his lack of business experience, and Bain moved to Boston in 1967 to join BCG.</p><p xmlns="">Bain was a philanthropist and a longtime trustee of several children's organizations in both Massachusetts and Florida, including Children's Hospital Boston, The Boys and Girls Clubs of Boston, and the Naples Children and Education Foundation.</p><p xmlns="">He had homes in Weston and Falmouth, Massachusetts.</p><p xmlns="">He is survived by his wife and four children. Memorial services are being planned in Naples and Boston.</p></xmlText><xmlFormatRef><keyVal xmlns="">XHTML</keyVal></xmlFormatRef></story></xml></log>
