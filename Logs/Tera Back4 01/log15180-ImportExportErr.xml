(TNS)</bycr></p><p xmlns="">DURHAM, N.C. — Duke freshman Marvin Bagley III will miss the Blue Devils’ game against Virginia Tech on Wednesday with a mild knee sprain, the school announced.</p><p xmlns="">It is the second game in a row Bagley will miss because of the injury, which he suffered last Thursday in Duke’s 82-78 loss to North Carolina.</p><p xmlns="">Bagley played all but one minute of that game, and finished with 15 points and 16 rebounds.</p><p xmlns="">On Tuesday, when asked by a reporter whether Bagley had practiced with the team since he sat out against Georgia Tech on Sunday, Duke freshman forward Wendell Carter Jr. said Bagley hadn’t.</p><p xmlns="">No. 12 Duke (20-5, 8-4 ACC) held practice Tuesday afternoon, a day before its game against Virginia Tech (18-7, 7-5 ACC) at Cameron Indoor Stadium. Bagley missed Sunday’s game at Georgia Tech as a precautionary measure, with what Duke officials called a “mild knee sprain.”</p><p xmlns="">Bagley has had a few minor injuries this season. He missed the last 30 minutes of Duke’s game against then-No. 2 Michigan State on Nov. 14 after he was poked in the eye by a teammate. Duke won that game 88-81 after a career-high 37-point performance from Duke senior guard Grayson Allen. Bagley returned the following game, a 78-61 win over Southern.</p><p xmlns="">Bagley also injured his shoulder against Miami on Jan. 15. He left the game briefly, but eventually returned in Duke’s 83-75 win.</p><p xmlns="">But Sunday’s game against Georgia Tech was the first one he missed all season. Marques Bolden, a 6-11, 246-pound center, started in Bagley’s place. Bolden, who is coming off a knee injury of his own, scored eight points and grabbed six rebounds in 25 minutes.</p><p xmlns="">Duke won in Atlanta, 80-69.</p><p xmlns="">Bagley, a 6-11, 234-pound forward, has been Duke’s best player this season. He leads the ACC in scoring (21.2) and rebounding (11.4).</p><p xmlns="">The Hokies are feeling confident, after coming off its best win of the season. Virginia Tech beat No. 2 Virginia 61-60 in overtime in Charlottesville on Saturday.</p><p xmlns="">“We just have to step up,” Carter said. “He comes and plays hard every day, every game. Marvin plays well on the offensive and defensive end so we just have to pick up that slack since he’s not out there with us.”</p><p xmlns="">———</p><p xmlns="">©2018 The News &amp; Observer (Raleigh, N.C.)</p><p xmlns="">Visit The News &amp; Observer (Raleigh, N.C.) at www.newsobserver.com</p><p xmlns="">Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.</p><p xmlns="">—————</p><p xmlns="">PHOTO (for help with images, contact 312-222-4194):</p><p xmlns="">_____</p><p xmlns="">Topics: t000002776,t000049144,t000002786,t000142246,g000221059,g000065627,g000362661,g000066164</p></xmlText><xmlFormatRef><keyVal xmlns="">XHTML</keyVal></xmlFormatRef></story></xml></log>
