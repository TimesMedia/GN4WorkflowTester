Anything declarer can do to further that goal is a step in the right direction.</t:p><t:p>Consider this deal where West led the ten of hearts against three notrump. Declarer took the trick with the ace and played the A-K and another club, won by East with the queen. East shifted to the queen of diamonds, and South went down two.</t:p><t:p>While it is true that South was unlucky to lose a club trick to East and also to find West with the ace of diamonds, the fact remains that he could have adopted a different line of play that would have ensured making at least three notrump.</t:p><t:p>All he had to do was to win the heart lead in dummy, lead the seven of clubs and let it ride if East followed low. If the seven lost to West's ten or queen, South would then have four club tricks and nine all told. If the seven won the trick because East had the queen and ten, five club tricks would become certain.</t:p><t:p>If East covered the seven with the ten, South would win with the king, return to dummy with a heart and play another club, intending to finesse if East followed low. This sequence of plays would be entirely consistent with the overall aim of keeping East out of the lead at all costs in order to avoid a possible killing diamond return.</t:p><t:p>Of course, if East showed out on the first club lead from dummy, South could still assure four club tricks and the contract by going up with the ace and returning a low club toward dummy's jack.</t:p><t:p>Tomorrow: A handy defensive device.</t:p><t:p>(c)2019 King Features Syndicate Inc.</t:p><t:p /><t:p /></t:t></tText></article></body></txts></article><txtGeometry name="3acde7dc-9b7d-469f-b2c3-4190bd88c4b1"><txtRef objectType="body"><keyRef objectType="folder"><keyVal>/HR/Production/In_Progress</keyVal></keyRef><keyVal>20191119</keyVal></txtRef><regionRef objectType="region"><keyRef objectType="title"><keyVal>HR</keyVal></keyRef><keyVal>Print</keyVal></regionRef><folderRef objectType="folder"><keyVal>/HR/Production/In_Progress</keyVal></folderRef><contextRef objectType="justContext"><keyRef objectType="justScope"><keyVal>HR</keyVal></keyRef><keyVal>vanillabody</keyVal></contextRef><data /><localGeometry /><jumps /></txtGeometry></objects></xml></log>
