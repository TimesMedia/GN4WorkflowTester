We're now in the position to really genuinely do that."</p><p>Coe, who took over the reins during a period of turmoil in world athletics, was re-elected by unanimous vote of the 203 delegates attending the International Association of Athletics Federations' Congress in Doha.</p><p>Four years ago the IAAF was in chaos as a result of far-reaching corruption allegations.</p><p>They included damaging charges of links between outgoing president Lamine Diack, his influential son Papa Massata, and a Russian cover-up of a state-sponsored doping conspiracy.</p><p></p><p></p><p>During his first term, Coe set up the independent Athletics Integrity Unit which serves as watchdog dedicated to cleaning up corruption in the sport.</p><p>"It's been a tough four years, the first two were the reforms -- the second two years were really making sure they were implemented," he said.</p><p>"(We) got here pretty much implementing everything we said we'd do.</p><p>"I want the next four years to be the fun bit... I want the sport to grow."</p><p>Coe is notably credited with tackling the issue of state-sponsored Russian doping, with the IAAF maintaining a tough stance and banning Russia from competition since November 2015.</p><p>Gender has also been a complex issue, with South African runner Caster Semenya spearheading the fight against IAAF rules on "hyperandrogenic" competitors whose significance goes beyond the boundaries of the sport.</p><p>The new regulations came into force on May 8 and oblige women with higher than normal male hormone levels to artificially lower their testosterone to run at some distances. </p><p>Semenya, the best-known athlete to fall foul of the rules, has refused to take the medication and consequently will not take part in Doha. </p><p>Semenya initially won a legal battle, enabling her to compete in 800m races, before a Swiss court overruled the decision.</p><p>Coe said "the issue of transgender more generally is going to be dominating, not just athletics, but all sports".</p><p>Two female Kenyan middle-distance runners have been dropped from the team for Doha due to high levels of testosterone.</p><p>Ximena Restrepo, a former sprinter from Colombia, was elected as an IAAF vice-president at the congress, the first time the body has elevated a woman to the position.</p><p>"It's a great moment for me and my country," she said.</p><p>"I would like to thank you Seb. Because of the changes you've done to the constitution, women are having more opportunities than before."</p><p>dr-rg-gw/cw</p><p></p><p class="credit">AFP</p></xmlText><xmlFormatRef><keyVal>XHTML</keyVal></xmlFormatRef></story></xml></log>
