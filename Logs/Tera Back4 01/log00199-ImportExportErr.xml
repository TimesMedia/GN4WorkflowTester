Puma shares were down 2.6% on Wednesday in early trading, while Kering's fell 0.7%.</p><p>Kering said in its statement that the initial exchange price set for the bonds would represent an exchange premium of 30%-35% over a reference share price for Puma.</p><p>Executives at the French luxury group had said in July that Kering was looking at "alternatives" for its Puma stake given how the shares had rallied, but added that the company did not intend to dispose of all of it.
