(TNS)</bycr></p><p xmlns="">CHAPEL HILL, N.C. — “The Streak” lives.</p><p xmlns="">Even an unbelievable shooting performance by Clemson couldn’t net the Tigers their first win in Chapel Hill, N.C.</p><p xmlns="">Cam Johnson led No. 15 North Carolina to its 59th straight home win over No. 20 Clemson with 21 points in an 87-79 decision at the Smith Center on Tuesday night.</p><p xmlns="">Clemson (15-3, 4-2 ACC) made 15 straight field goals, and didn’t miss for more than 12 minutes in the second half, to trim what was an 18-point deficit down to 2 but UNC (15-4, 4-2) never gave up the lead.</p><p xmlns="">With the Tar Heels clinging to a 66-64 lead, Johnson buried one of his six 3-pointers for some breathing room.</p><p xmlns="">After a pair of free throws by Marcquise Reed (21 points), UNC’s defense came up with a shot-clock violation and Luke Maye added another 3 to keep UNC up 72-66.</p><p xmlns="">Maye, who needed five stitches to close up a cut on his nose he suffered in the first half, added another 3 at 1:49 to make it 78-70.</p><p xmlns="">Theo Pinson’s late free throws (8 of 8) kept “The Streak,” the longest home streak in NCAA history, safe for another year.</p><p xmlns="">It was definitely in doubt there the way Clemson was making every shot it took.</p><p xmlns="">They kept whittling away at the lead, and not missing, for 12 minutes. David Skara finally missed a 3-pointer at 7:02 but by that point the Tigers only trailed 66-62. They finished 19 of 31 (61.3 percent) in the second half.</p><p xmlns="">Kenny Williams led UNC early, with 12 first-half points, as the Heels built a 38-23 halftime lead. UNC’s passing was particularly sharp with 11 assists on its first 12 field goals.</p><p xmlns="">Clemson looked out of sorts and trailed 20-8 in the first 9 minutes. Even the absence of Maye, who missed the last 2 minutes of the half after getting a cut on his nose, didn’t spark Clemson.</p><p xmlns="">It wasn’t until Shelton Mitchell missed the first shot of the second half, a 3-pointer, that Clemson got in gear.</p><p xmlns="">But UNC wouldn’t let “The Streak” die.</p><p xmlns="">———</p><p xmlns="">©2018 The News &amp; Observer (Raleigh, N.C.)</p><p xmlns="">Visit The News &amp; Observer (Raleigh, N.C.) at www.newsobserver.com</p><p xmlns="">Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.</p><p xmlns="">_____</p><p xmlns="">Topics: g000225474,g000362661,g000065792,g000066164</p></xmlText><xmlFormatRef><keyVal xmlns="">XHTML</keyVal></xmlFormatRef></story></xml></log>
