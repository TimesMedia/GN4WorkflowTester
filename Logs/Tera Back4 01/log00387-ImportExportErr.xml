The dollar advanced.</p><p>Contracts for all three main equity gauges signaled more declines at the New York open as traders grappled with the impeachment investigation into President Donald Trump, seemingly getting little comfort from a Bloomberg report that China is preparing to buy more U.S. pork. The Stoxx Europe 600 index headed for its biggest drop in six weeks, led by Electricite de France SA, which announced extra costs and a possible delay in building two atomic reactors in Britain. Asian benchmarks retreated across the board, with losses of more than 1% in Hong Kong, South Korea, mainland China and India.</p><p>Crude futures declined after Saudi Aramco said it was ahead of schedule in restoring output that was reduced by a drone attack earlier in September. A dollar gauge was on track for its biggest advance in a week as the yen fell and Treasuries stabilized.</p><p>Markets have seemed to gyrate on the twists and turns of the protectionist battle between the two largest economies, with this year’s epic bond rally recovering from a pullback and U.S. stocks lingering within sight of a record high. The sudden escalation of political risk in Washington comes as economic signals deteriorate globally, adding a fresh complication for investors trying to decide whether central banks will be able to shore up growth.</p><p>Elsewhere, the pound reversed its Tuesday gain as U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson returned to the country after Britain’s Supreme Court ruled that he’d broken the law by suspending Parliament. In Japan, five-year government bond yields fell to a record low following comments from central bank Governor Haruhiko Kuroda that added to speculation of an interest-rate cut in October.</p><p>These are some key events coming up this week:</p><p>Here are the main moves in markets:</p><p>Stocks</p><p>Currencies</p><p>Bonds</p><p>Commodities</p><p>--With assistance from Sarah Ponczek, Vildana Hajric and Adam Haigh.</p><p>To contact the reporter on this story: Todd White in Madrid at twhite2@bloomberg.net</p><p>To contact the editor responsible for this story: Samuel Potter at spotter33@bloomberg.net</p><p>For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com</p><p>©2019 Bloomberg L.P.</p></xmlText><xmlFormatRef><keyVal>XHTML</keyVal></xmlFormatRef></story></xml></log>
