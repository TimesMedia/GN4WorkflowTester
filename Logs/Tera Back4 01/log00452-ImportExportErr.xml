In the longer term, Germany’s TUI should also benefit from the exit of its biggest rival in Europe’s $47 billion package-holiday market.</p><p>TUI has already been leasing planes because of the global grounding of the Boeing Co. 737 Max after two fatal crashes, of which it has 15 in the fleet with several more due to have been taken this year.</p><p>The Hanover-based company earlier moved to calm investors after Thomas Cook’s failure, saying in a statement that the summer season is “closing out in line with expectations,” with its model of owning hotels and cruise ships outright proving resilient.</p><p>Industry Squeeze</p><p>Joussen said the market is “still not where it should be” as the tourism sector is roiled slowing economies, fluctuating oil prices, a strong dollar, uncertainty around Brexit and changing booking patterns in response to warmer summers in northern Europe.</p><p>Asked what Thomas Cook’s failure says about the industry, he said that “those who change will be successful, those who don’t won’t.” European leisure airlines still have too much capacity and with so many external risks in play TUI must be “careful,” he said.</p><p>A TUI spokesman said the company is not interested in Thomas Cook’s Frankfurt-based airline Condor, which is continuing to operate while seeking a buyer. The carrier is set to receive a 380 million-euro ($420 million) bridge loan from the German government, valid for six months, provided that the European Commission approves the plan.</p><p>In contrast, Thomas Cook’s German tour operating arm with the Neckermann Reisen, Oeger Tours and Bucher Reisen brands filed for insolvency, according to a statement Wednesday.</p><p>UBS analyst Cristian Nedelcu said in a note Tuesday that any boost to TUI’s profitability and free cash flow could prove to be fleeting as other companies also move to fill the gap left by Thomas Cook within a year or two.</p><p>Joussen said he remains hopeful that the Boeing Max will return to service this year as the U.S. manufacturer works with regulators on changes to flight-control software blamed for the crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia.</p><p>To contact the reporter on this story: Richard Weiss in Frankfurt at rweiss5@bloomberg.net</p><p>To contact the editors responsible for this story: Daniel Schaefer at dschaefer36@bloomberg.net, ;Tara Patel at tpatel2@bloomberg.net, Christopher Jasper</p><p>For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com</p><p>©2019 Bloomberg L.P.</p></xmlText><xmlFormatRef><keyVal>XHTML</keyVal></xmlFormatRef></story></xml></log>
