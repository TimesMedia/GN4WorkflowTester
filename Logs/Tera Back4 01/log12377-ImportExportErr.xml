Only Republicans supported the nomination. All Democrats opposed it. The closeness of the vote indicates that Goodfriend, an economics professor at Carnegie Mellon University, could face significant opposition when his nomination goes before the full Senate where Republicans have a one-vote majority.</p><p xmlns="">Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the top Democrat on the committee, said Goodfriend's past support for imposing restrictions on the Fed's independence and for eliminating the central bank's mandate to seek maximum employment were troubling.</p></xmlText><xmlFormatRef><keyVal xmlns="">XHTML</keyVal></xmlFormatRef></story></xml></log>
