And ... my bank had weakened defences. It was not bad faith, we just weren't organised," he said.</p><p>Trust in the bank has been further dented after a scandal, in which it failed to inform customers that it expected a poor performance from an investment product called Flexinvest Fri and continued to sell the product after raising fees associated with it.</p><p>"We will find things, I'm sure. Flexinvest is one, but we'll find more," said Vogelzang, who took over on June 1.
