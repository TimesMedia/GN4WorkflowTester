(TNS)</bycr></p><p xmlns="">If your last blood pressure check at the doctor’s office didn’t raise concerns, new medical guidelines could change that in 2018.</p><p xmlns="">The mark now considered to be high blood pressure is 130/80, compared with the previous 140/90, under new guidelines released in November by the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology.</p><p xmlns="">The shift likely will catch tens of millions of Americans by surprise because they previously got a pass from doctors, according to internal medicine physician Dawn DeWitt in Spokane. Many of the newly diagnosed likely won’t go on medication but rather will be advised to make lifestyle changes, she said, such as lose weight, stop smoking, and exercise regularly.</p><p xmlns="">“The logic behind the new guidelines is that the sooner high blood pressure is diagnosed and treated, the greater the chance of preventing problems,” said DeWitt, associate dean of clinical education at Washington State University’s Elson S. Floyd College of Medicine.</p><p xmlns="">“They released these new guidelines saying to some degree, all these heart attacks and strokes are, quote, preventable. It’s saying if we treat hypertension better, we can prevent or delay many of these events, a lot of which are either severely debilitating or life-ending, so it’s not a small thing.”</p><p xmlns="">The move also acknowledges that heart disease, strokes, and related conditions are generally a long-term process.</p><p xmlns="">“It’s not like your arteries are perfect one week and the next week, boom, you’ve got a heart attack,” she said. “It takes time. Other than smoking, obesity and hypertension are the two biggest entwined factors for the general population.”</p><p xmlns="">About 85 million adults, or one in three, in the U.S. have high blood pressure, according to a project of the AHA and American Medical Association called Target BP. The 2015-launched initiative offers support while urging medical services and patients to prioritize blood pressure control.</p><p xmlns="">The AHA defines high blood pressure, also known as hypertension, as being when the force of the blood flowing through your blood vessels is consistently too high. The body’s tissues and organs need the oxygenated blood that the circulatory system caries.</p><p xmlns="">When the heart beats, it creates pressure that pushes blood through a network of tube-shaped blood vessels, including arteries, veins and capillaries. This pressure — blood pressure — is the result of two forces. The first is systolic pressure occurring as blood pumps out of the heart and into the arteries. The second is diastolic pressure, created as the heart rests between heart beats, the AHA says.</p><p xmlns="">These two forces are represented by the numbers in a blood pressure reading.</p><p xmlns="">Obesity is a significant factor toward heart disease, and since the 1970s, rates within the U.S. population in overweight and obese categories have increased significantly, according to DeWitt. Generally, blood pressure increases as people gain weight.</p><p xmlns="">“There’s a general consensus that heart disease and strokes are basically the No. 1 killer of Americans, and that’s gotten worse with the obesity epidemic.”</p><p xmlns="">The new blood pressure guidelines have both financial and psychological impacts, she said. The cost could be in lifestyle changes — paying to go to the doctor more, exercise classes, lifestyle coaching, gym memberships. Psychologically, some people who have never had a disease before suddenly are labeled as having hypertension, she said.</p><p xmlns="">“The implications of making that announcement are that overnight millions and millions more Americans would be classified as having hypertension,” DeWitt said. And it could be considered a preexisting condition, “so in all the uncertainly with Republican health reform, if we went back to situation where people could be denied health insurance coverage for a preexisting condition, to have people labeled with hypertension when they weren’t previously labeled, that’s a big crunch.”</p><p xmlns="">Medical research and history since the 1960s regarding what constitutes high blood pressure is complicated, added DeWitt, although medical experts generally agree about its link to heart disease.</p><p xmlns="">“It’s a fascinating story because the evidence about blood pressure over the years has been up and down, shall we say, no pun intended,” DeWitt said. “For few years, doctors sort of thought well anything that wasn’t really high, so 160 over 90, wasn’t too bad.”</p><p xmlns="">In the 1960s, doctors had only about two drugs available to treat high blood pressure, she said. Then studies in the 1980s and 90s brought intriguing evidence from some trials trial that lower blood pressure was good, but still, guidelines tended to go back and forth between 140/90 and 130/80.</p><p xmlns="">Meanwhile, the number of medications available to treat hypertension increased, creating a more complicated landscape today, added DeWitt.</p><p xmlns="">“Over half of adults require three or more medications to control blood pressure to 140 over 90,” she said. “At that point, 50 to 60 percent of Americans are rated as uncontrolled by their chart.”</p><p xmlns="">Additionally, researchers also consider there’s a significant amount of “white coat hypertension,” DeWitt said, meaning when patients come into the doctor’s office, they’ve experienced more stress about getting to the appointment on time, parking, doing paperwork and figuring out insurance, “so they get into doctor’s office and their blood pressure is higher.”</p><p xmlns="">“It became pretty clear that ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, where somebody wears a monitor for 24 hours is more accurate in terms of predicting downstream complications of high blood pressure.”</p><p xmlns="">“We also decided home blood pressure monitoring was probably better than office blood pressure monitoring, but blood pressure cuffs aren’t cheap. For lay people to use them, you generally need automated ones that aren’t always accurate, so there are all kinds of factors. Are we measuring blood pressure correctly or are people walking around with lower blood pressure than we get in the office?”</p><p xmlns="">Other contributing factors toward heart disease for some Americans are cholesterol and diabetes. Salt intake is somewhat controversial within the topic, she said. But for some people, reducing salt can make a difference in blood pressure.</p><p xmlns="">“Smoking goes without saying,” she said. “The next implications on the good side is that most people classified with hypertension, they have the option for treatment with lifestyle changes, lose a few pounds, increase exercise, decrease salt and junk food, stop smoking.”</p><p xmlns="">MORE INFORMATION</p><p xmlns="">The American Heart Association offers blood pressure information at its website, www.heart.org. It’s also involved in an initiative called Target BP, www.targetbp.org. AHA offers some of the following guidelines.</p><p xmlns="">Your blood pressure is recorded as two numbers:</p><p xmlns="">Systolic blood pressure (the upper number) — indicates how much pressure your blood is exerting against your artery walls when the heart beats.</p><p xmlns="">Diastolic blood pressure (the lower number) — indicates how much pressure your blood is exerting against your artery walls while the heart is resting between beats.</p><p xmlns="">Normal blood pressure is within the optimal range of less than 120/80. Elevated blood pressure is when readings are consistently ranging from 120-129 systolic and less than 80 diastolic.</p><p xmlns="">Hypertension Stage 1 is when blood pressure is consistently ranging from 130-139 systolic or 80-89 diastolic. At this stage, doctors are likely to prescribe lifestyle changes and may consider adding blood pressure medication based on your risk of cardiovascular disease.</p><p xmlns="">Hypertension Stage 2 is when blood pressure is consistently ranging at levels of 140/90 or higher. At this stage, doctors are likely to prescribe a combination of medications and lifestyle changes.</p><p xmlns="">———</p><p xmlns="">©2018 The Spokesman-Review (Spokane, Wash.)</p><p xmlns="">Visit The Spokesman-Review (Spokane, Wash.) online at spokesman.com.</p><p xmlns="">Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.</p><p xmlns="">—————</p><p xmlns="">TO SUBSCRIBE TO 50-PLUS</p><p xmlns="">This column/content is for subscribers only.
