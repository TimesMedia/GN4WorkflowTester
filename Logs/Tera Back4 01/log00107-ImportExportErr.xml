It won’t affect common equity Tier 1 capital. The bank also announced a dividend payment of 10 euro cents a share.</p><p>Santander UK, the lender’s fourth-largest unit, has struggled amid increased competition in the mortgage market, heavy regulation and Brexit uncertainty. Profit at the unit fell 13% in the second quarter from a year earlier on reduced income from lending and fees.</p><p>The bank also suffered losses on refunds to customers who were given inaccurate information when sold payment-protection insurance. It reported a second-quarter charge of 108 million euros, in part from costs related to the shuttering of 140 U.K. branches.</p><p>Santander in 2017 took a 600-million euro charge to reflect lower earnings at Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc, its unit focused on subprime auto loans.</p><p>The Spanish lender entered the U.K. market with the acquisition of building society Abbey National in 2004. It expanded with the purchases of Bradford &amp; Bingley and Alliance &amp; Leicester in 2008 and 2009 and rebranded in 2010 as Santander UK.</p><p>To contact the reporter on this story: Charlie Devereux in Madrid at cdevereux3@bloomberg.net</p><p>To contact the editors responsible for this story: Dale Crofts at dcrofts@bloomberg.net, Dan Reichl, Steve Dickson</p><p>For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com</p><p>©2019 Bloomberg L.P.</p></xmlText><xmlFormatRef><keyVal>XHTML</keyVal></xmlFormatRef></story></xml></log>
