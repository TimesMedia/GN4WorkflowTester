Oil fell.</p><p>Technology and banking shares led the Stoxx Europe 600 index toward its biggest drop in six weeks. Asian equities retreated hours after the biggest decline for the S&amp;P 500 Index in a month in the wake of an announcement the U.S. House of Representatives is opening a formal impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump. Contracts for all three main equity gauges in New York dipped, with investors seemingly getting little comfort from a Bloomberg report that China is preparing to buy more U.S. pork.</p><p>Crude futures extended declines after Saudi Aramco said it was ahead of schedule in restoring output that was reduced by a drone attack earlier this month. A dollar gauge headed toward its biggest advance in a week, the yen fell, and Treasuries stabilized.</p><p>Markets have seemed to gyrate on the twists and turns of the protectionist battle between the two largest economies, with this year’s epic bond rally recovering from a pullback and U.S. stocks lingering within sight of a record high. The sudden escalation of political risk in Washington comes as economic signals deteriorate globally, adding a fresh complication for investors trying to decide whether central banks will be able to shore up growth.</p><p>Elsewhere, the pound reversed its Tuesday gain as U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson returned to the country after Britain’s Supreme Court ruled that he’d broken the law by suspending Parliament. In Japan, five-year government bond yields fell to a record low following comments from central bank Governor Haruhiko Kuroda that added to speculation of an interest-rate cut in October.</p><p>These are some key events coming up this week:</p><p>Here are the main moves in markets:</p><p>Stocks</p><p>Currencies</p><p>Bonds</p><p>Commodities</p><p>--With assistance from Sarah Ponczek, Vildana Hajric and Adam Haigh.</p><p>To contact the reporter on this story: Todd White in Madrid at twhite2@bloomberg.net</p><p>To contact the editor responsible for this story: Samuel Potter at spotter33@bloomberg.net</p><p>For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com</p><p>©2019 Bloomberg L.P.</p></xmlText><xmlFormatRef><keyVal>XHTML</keyVal></xmlFormatRef></story></xml></log>
