The issue however is you have a company with a market cap of 31 billion euros that is currently trading at a year low in a sector that has become increasingly more regulated in terms of price caps," said MB Capital director Marcus Bullus.</p><p>Unit 1 of Hinkley Point C is still expected to begin generating power from the end of 2025, EDF said.</p><p>"Our earthworks are complete, but challenging ground conditions meant we overspent to finish them on time," Stuart Crooks, managing director of Hinkley Point C, wrote in a letter to staff.</p><p>State-controlled EDF is building the plant with China General Nuclear Power Corp.
