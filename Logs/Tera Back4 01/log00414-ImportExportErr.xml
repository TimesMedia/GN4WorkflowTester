The approach is expected to be above AMS’s 38.50 euros-a-share offer that’s valued at 3.7 billion euros ($4.1 billion), they said.</p><p>Spokespeople for Bain, Advent, Osram declined to comment. </p><p>Bain’s pursuit of Osram has fresh momentum after teaming up with Advent as a replacement for its earlier partner Carlyle Group, which backed away from the transaction. The private equity firms will need to snatch the initiative away from AMS, which trumped an earlier 35 euro-a-share offer and won the support of Osram’s board.</p><p>The door is open to a come back. Management of the German lighting maker expressed some reservations about AMS’s proposal and Osram’s workforce had come out in favor of Bain and Carlyle.</p><p>To contact the reporters on this story: Sarah Syed in London at ssyed35@bloomberg.net;Eyk Henning in Frankfurt at ehenning1@bloomberg.net;Oliver Sachgau in Munich at osachgau@bloomberg.net</p><p>To contact the editors responsible for this story: Anthony Palazzo at apalazzo@bloomberg.net, Andrew Noël</p><p>For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com</p><p>©2019 Bloomberg L.P.</p></xmlText><xmlFormatRef><keyVal>XHTML</keyVal></xmlFormatRef></story></xml></log>
