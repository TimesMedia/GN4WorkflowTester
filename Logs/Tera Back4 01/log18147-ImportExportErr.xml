Experts make the choices; you just lean back on your couch.</p><p xmlns="">That's not to say alternatives to the main NBC broadcast are pointless. NBC's website and app let you catch up on what you missed — though with more than 175 hours on the main channel alone, catching up might have to wait until after the games end.</p></xmlText><xmlFormatRef><keyVal xmlns="">XHTML</keyVal></xmlFormatRef></story></xml></log>
