Further investigation led agents to a vehicle suspected of being involved, which they pulled over on Interstate 5 about 12:10 p.m.</p><p xmlns="">Three men were inside: the driver, a 20-year-old DACA recipient whose status had expired, and two Mexican nationals, ages 21 and 22, suspected of being in the country illegally.</p><p xmlns="">Federal officials said the driver and his cousin, the 22-year-old passenger, told agents they had been involved in human smuggling in the area. The driver is currently in federal custody.</p><p xmlns="">The second incident happened on Thursday about 8 a.m. Border Patrol agents in East San Diego County had just arrested two people on suspicion of being in the country illegally when they spotted two suspicious vehicles in Campo.</p><p xmlns="">The agents followed one of the vehicles and conducted an immigration inspection at a nearby checkpoint.</p><p xmlns="">The driver — a 22-year-old Mexican national who lived in Riverside County as a DACA recipient — ultimately told agents that he and another driver were scouting the area to aid a group of smugglers, federal officials said.</p><p xmlns="">The agents also learned the man had committed other acts of human smuggling, according to federal officials. The suspect, who was not identified, is in Department of Homeland Security custody awaiting removal proceedings. Agents later arrested another man, a 25-year-old United States citizen, who was also suspected in the smuggling scheme.</p><p xmlns="">———</p><p xmlns="">©2018 The San Diego Union-Tribune</p><p xmlns="">Visit The San Diego Union-Tribune at www.sandiegouniontribune.com</p><p xmlns="">Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.</p><p xmlns="">—————</p><p xmlns="">PHOTO (for help with images, contact 312-222-4194): Border Fence</p></xmlText><xmlFormatRef><keyVal xmlns="">XHTML</keyVal></xmlFormatRef></story></xml></log>
