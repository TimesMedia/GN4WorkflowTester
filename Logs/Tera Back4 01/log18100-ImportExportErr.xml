Eric Hosmer.</p><p xmlns="">The Padres, deep into their year-long chase of the biggest signee in franchise history, hired Cameron shortly after he wrote, “Hosmer could very easily become one of the most overpaid players in baseball.”</p><p xmlns="">This isn’t about whether you buy into what Cameron wrote then or where he works now. This is about the underpinnings of an organization beginning to show the complexity of its thinking and approach as real dollars reshape the diamond.</p><p xmlns="">If the Padres wanted “yes” men, they don’t hire Cameron. If they wanted unchallenged back-patting, insincere nods and fear-based silence, that blog and this player shake out differently in the hallways of the team’s spring training facility.</p><p xmlns="">Rewind it all with A.J. Preller and a wry smile works its way across the general manager’s face.</p><p xmlns="">“Any successful group, you don’t just want groupthink and everybody having the same mindset and thought process,” Preller said minutes after Hosmer’s introductory news conference. “Those are healthy debates and discussions.</p><p xmlns="">“Any decision, whether it’s a big free-agent signing or a Rule 5 draft pick or a 10th-round pick in the amateur draft, it’s healthy when you have guys with strong opinions. That’s how you make the best decisions. We take a lot of pride on having different opinions.”</p><p xmlns="">The contract that transformed Hosmer from a Royal to a Padre was constructed far away from baseball’s groupthink.</p><p xmlns="">No one has constructed a deal of this length, eight years, during this extremely unusual offseason for free agents. The deal is believed to be one of the first front-loaded contracts co-signed by mega-agent Scott Boras, who quickly followed with another when J.D. Martinez signed with Boston.</p><p xmlns="">Hosmer owns an opt-out clause after five seasons. Advantage, Hosmer.</p><p xmlns="">The Padres, however, see it as a strategic edge on their end as well. If Hosmer plays well and leaves early, they’ll reap the benefits of the production while re-deploying $39 million. If the four-time Gold Glove- and Silver Slugger-winning Hosmer stays, the deal slows to $13 million per season in the final three years — leaving $21 million more to invest in young talent bubbling up in a re-energized farm system.</p><p xmlns="">“We wanted it structured in a manner that worked for us in terms of the younger players,” Padres Executive Chairman Ron Fowler said Tuesday. “When you look at it, we front-loaded the contract that way because we felt like we needed some flexibility on the back end.</p><p xmlns="">“If everything goes well, we get another bite of the apple.”</p><p xmlns="">Hiring the blog author who posted a giant, red stop sign on Hosmer illustrates a broader way of doing business than many of us imagined. Re-thinking how to build a long-term deal that keeps opening-day payroll around $90 million now and safeguards options later showed some fancy footwork as well.</p><p xmlns="">There’s not a long track record of franchises entering into negotiations with Boras and rewriting the script.</p><p xmlns="">Analytics fueled debates about Hosmer’s range at first base, though the Padres will tell you the Royals hugged the lines — and skewed the metrics as a result. Those nagging numbers will claim, too, that Hosmer hits too many ground balls.</p><p xmlns="">There’s no doubt, however, that the Padres researched Hosmer until their typing and note-taking fingers cramped. Then they re-imagined how to make an investment of that magnitude fit without sinking all the development swirling about.</p><p xmlns="">“A.J.’s background is in scouting and development,” Boras said. “He has to do a lot of character evaluations in his work. I think that came to light as we talked. … And I think (Managing Partner) Peter (Seidler) and Ron’s business acumen is one that, they understand the importance of the human element.</p><p xmlns="">“Our analytics don’t cover championship play. They’re void of what players do in the most important moments.”</p><p xmlns="">On the day Hosmer was announced, pitcher Matt Strahm echoed the Padres’ shake-convention thinking.</p><p xmlns="">“You can’t put into an analytics what Hosmer brings to a team,” Strahm said. “Show me that on a computer.”</p><p xmlns="">Seidler said the reputation of Preller and baseball ops being driven by the haze of new-age baseball numbers paints only part of the picture.</p><p xmlns="">“The first thing A.J. brings up are the personal qualities,” Seidler said. “I know A.J. is very skilled on the analytics side, but I think more important to him is the personal side. I’ve seen that talking to A.J. about Clayton Richard, Chris Young, Eric Hosmer, Manny Margot, Adrian Morejon — the old, the young and everything in between.”</p><p xmlns="">The Padres failed to blink at eight years, at least eight years on their terms.</p><p xmlns="">“Not at all,” Seidler said. “Not with this player.”</p><p xmlns="">Padres bench coach Mark McGwire, who witnessed winners being built first-hand in Oakland and St. Louis, said big-picture fit rarely comes with a number.</p><p xmlns="">“Perfect timing. Everything’s in place,” McGwire said of the Hosmer signing. “We have the right coaching staff. We absolutely have the right manager. We absolutely have the right general manager. We have these future stars.</p><p xmlns="">“We needed one that one guy who’s that glue in the clubhouse. His name has been in conversation for a long time in this clubhouse.”</p><p xmlns="">We learned a lot about the new-look Padres because of Hosmer. The wheels are turning. The risk feels confident, not flailing. Business has become anything but usual.</p><p xmlns="">Yes men? Not anymore.</p><p xmlns="">———</p><p xmlns="">©2018 The San Diego Union-Tribune</p><p xmlns="">Visit The San Diego Union-Tribune at www.sandiegouniontribune.com</p><p xmlns="">Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.</p><p xmlns="">—————</p><p xmlns="">PHOTOS (for help with images, contact 312-222-4194):</p><p xmlns="">_____</p><p xmlns="">Topics: t000003270,t000003271,t000007309,t000007333,t000424479,t000007391,t000003183</p></xmlText><xmlFormatRef><keyVal xmlns="">XHTML</keyVal></xmlFormatRef></story></xml></log>
