Bloomberg reported this month that the company might return to the bond market after a $190 million placement in April.</p><p>Aston Martin is staking future growth on a predicted sales surge from the DBX, which will be built at a new factory in Wales that opened in June. In the meantime, the carmaker has been treading water while confronting a weaker auto market and challenges from Brexit and global trade wars.</p><p>Chief Executive Officer Andy Palmer said the bond issue amounts to “insurance to make the bridge to DBX.” He said the company remains confident about demand for the model, with conditions for the potential second tranche of bonds specifying orders of 1,400 cars by the middle of next year.</p><p>Shares of Aston Martin traded 0.3% higher at 576.60 pence as of 8:03 a.m. in London.

That should allay fears.”</p><p>The U.K. carmaker generated about 900,000 pounds of cash from operations in the first half, the lowest since it started to disclose earnings, data compiled by Bloomberg show.</p><p>(Updates with comments from CEO from fourth paragraph.)</p><p>--With assistance from Thomas Mulier.</p><p>To contact the reporter on this story: Siddharth Philip in London at sphilip3@bloomberg.net</p><p>To contact the editors responsible for this story: Tara Patel at tpatel2@bloomberg.net, Christopher Jasper, Andrew Noël</p><p>For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com</p><p>©2019 Bloomberg L.P.</p></xmlText><xmlFormatRef><keyVal>XHTML</keyVal></xmlFormatRef></story></xml></log>
