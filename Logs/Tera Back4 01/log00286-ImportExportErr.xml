Some 66 people were injured, police said.</p><p>A soldier and three civilians also died in the provincial capital Jayapura, where security forces and stone-throwing protesters clashed Monday.</p><p>The soldier was stabbed to death and three students died from rubber bullet wounds, authorities have said, without elaborating.</p><p>On Tuesday evening, the district head office in Yalimo, near Wamena, was set ablaze, police said.</p><p>The United Liberation Movement for West Papua described this week's violence as a "massacre" and said that 17 Papuan high school students had been gunned down by Indonesian security forces.</p><p>Neither the military nor the separatist movement's claims could be independently verified. </p><p>Conflicting accounts are common in Papua and the government appears to have renewed a region-wide Internet service shutdown.</p><p>Jakarta has said the riots were meant to draw attention to Papuan independence at this week's UN General Assembly.</p><p>A low-level separatist insurgency has simmered for decades in the former Dutch colony after Jakarta took over the mineral-rich region in the 1960s.</p><p>A UN-sponsored vote to stay within the archipelago in 1969 was widely viewed as rigged, but Jakarta has long refused to consider another referendum.</p><p>The majority of Papuans are Christian and ethnic Melanesian with few cultural ties to the rest of Muslim-majority Indonesia.</p><p>str-dsa/pb/jah</p><p class="credit">AFP</p></xmlText><xmlFormatRef><keyVal>XHTML</keyVal></xmlFormatRef></story></xml></log>
