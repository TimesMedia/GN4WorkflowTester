The mine was where 34 striking miners died in 2012 after being shot by police in an event that would become known as the 'Marikana massacre'.</p><p>The job losses at the operations taken over from Lonmin - which account for over 26,000 staff - are significantly smaller than those Lonmin announced in 2017, thanks to an improvement in prices for platinum group metals, Sibanye-Stillwater said.</p><p>The company has also been cutting jobs in its gold mining operations in a country where job cuts are politically sensitive due to widespread unemployment - especially in the mining sector, where frequent, mass redundancies often affect poor, black workers.</p><p>South Africa's unemployment rate hit a 11-year high of 29% in the second quarter of the year, with mining suffering the biggest decline as it lost 54,000 positions.</p><p>Sibanye-Stillwater said the cuts at Marikana would be subject to a consultation process, which would seek to avoid retrenchments and seek alternatives to the closure or downscaling of operations at the affected shafts.</p><p>(Reporting by Alexander Winning and Emma Rumney; editing by Jason Neely and Deepa Babington)</p></xmlText><xmlFormatRef><keyVal>XHTML</keyVal></xmlFormatRef></story></xml></log>
