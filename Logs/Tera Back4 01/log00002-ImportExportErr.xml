The South player who bid the hand as shown certainly vindicated his optimistic leap to slam by a rather ingenious succession of plays.</t:p><t:p>When dummy came down, South saw that the slam was in the bag if he could avoid losing two club tricks. Looking at all four hands, it is easy to see that the winning play is to lead a club toward dummy at some point and, if West follows low, play the king.</t:p><t:p>But with the East-West hands concealed, how to play the clubs is essentially a toss-up. If West has the queen and East the ace, the winning play is to lead to dummy's jack.</t:p><t:p>With this crucial guess looming on the horizon, South decided he could add greatly to his chances by laying a trap for West. After winning the heart lead, he cashed the A-K of trump and continued with four rounds of diamonds, carefully discarding dummy's last heart on his last diamond.</t:p><t:p>The heart discard did not in itself increase the number of tricks declarer could take, but it planted the seed firmly in West's mind that South had started with two hearts and that the heart discard from dummy was vital.</t:p><t:p>Since declarer was known at this point to have started with six spades, four diamonds and presumably two hearts, he could have only one club. Consequently, when South next led the club eight, West rushed up with the ace, thereby relieving declarer of the guess. The specter of losing his ace and allowing South to make seven -- an important consideration at matchpoint scoring -- had done West in.</t:p><t:p>When the hand was over and West saw how neatly he had been swindled, he could not help but feel a sneaking admiration for the way South had duped him, and congratulated him on his imaginative line of play.</t:p><t:p>Tomorrow: Putting the pieces together.</t:p><t:p>(c)2019 King Features Syndicate Inc.</t:p><t:p /><t:p /></t:t></tText></article></body></txts></article><txtGeometry name="95a57711-46d8-4541-a015-f9012bd6fde6"><txtRef objectType="body"><keyRef objectType="folder"><keyVal>/HR/Production/In_Progress</keyVal></keyRef><keyVal>20191113</keyVal></txtRef><regionRef objectType="region"><keyRef objectType="title"><keyVal>HR</keyVal></keyRef><keyVal>Print</keyVal></regionRef><folderRef objectType="folder"><keyVal>/HR/Production/In_Progress</keyVal></folderRef><contextRef objectType="justContext"><keyRef objectType="justScope"><keyVal>HR</keyVal></keyRef><keyVal>vanillabody</keyVal></contextRef><data /><localGeometry /><jumps /></txtGeometry></objects></xml></log>
