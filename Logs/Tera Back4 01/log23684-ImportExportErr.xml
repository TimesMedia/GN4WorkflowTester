California allows immigrants living in the country illegally to obtain drivers licenses, leading some websites to falsely claim they'll be automatically signed up to vote.</p><p xmlns="">California's new program has safeguards to ensure only U.S. citizens can go through the voter registration process. A DMV worker processing a drivers' license application for an undocumented immigrant, for example, will not be able to access the voter registration boxes, which will be greyed out.</p><p xmlns="">"To be eligible, you have to be a U.S. citizen," said Jessica Gonzalez, a DMV spokeswoman.</p><p xmlns="">___</p><p xmlns="">This is part of The Associated Press' ongoing effort to fact-check misinformation that is shared widely online, including work with Facebook to identify and reduce the circulation of false stories on the platform.</p></xmlText><xmlFormatRef><keyVal xmlns="">XHTML</keyVal></xmlFormatRef></story></xml></log>
