Center before Saturday’s win. A hot-shooting start had a lot to do with UNC’s success.</p><p xmlns="">Berry, Cam Johnson (12 points) and Theo Pinson (19 points) — with only his third 3-pointer in ACC play — helped UNC shoot Louisville (18-9, 8-6) out of an early zone.</p><p xmlns="">The Cardinals were down 19-6 before they could blink. UNC started 6 of 9 from the 3-point line and led 40-21 before Louisville made a move.</p><p xmlns="">Berry had 18 points and half of UNC’s eight 3s in the first half. The Cards made a 17-5 run to cut UNC’s lead to 45-38 with 1:34 left in the half.</p><p xmlns="">Junior forward Deng Adel, who had missed the previous two games with an ankle injury, came off the bench and scored 13 points in the first half to lead Louisville’s comeback.</p><p xmlns="">The Cardinals trailed 49-40 at the half and could only get as close as seven points in the second half. Adel finished with 20 points and junior forward Ray Spalding added 18 points and 12 rebounds.</p><p xmlns="">Louisville, with a size advantage, held UNC forward Luke Maye to two points in the first half but Maye came alive in the second half and finished with 19 points and 13 rebounds.</p><p xmlns="">Maye’s 3-pointer, falling away, at 3:22 extinguished any hope of a late Louisville rally.</p><p xmlns="">———</p><p xmlns="">©2018 The News &amp; Observer (Raleigh, N.C.)</p><p xmlns="">Visit The News &amp; Observer (Raleigh, N.C.) at www.newsobserver.com</p><p xmlns="">Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.</p><p xmlns="">_____</p><p xmlns="">Topics: g000065650,g000220400,g000362661,g000066164,g000065598</p></xmlText><xmlFormatRef><keyVal xmlns="">XHTML</keyVal></xmlFormatRef></story></xml></log>
