(TNS)</bycr></p><p xmlns="">CHAPEL HILL, N.C. — North Carolina was due for a letdown after emotional wins over Duke and N.C. State.</p><p xmlns="">Theo Pinson made sure the Tar Heels had enough juice to handle Notre Dame on Monday night. The do-everything senior led the 14th-ranked Heels to a 83-66 win over the Fighting Irish for their third win in five days.</p><p xmlns="">UNC (20-7, 9-5 ACC) was understandably sluggish in spurts. Even the late-arriving crowd took some time to get cranked back up after it had emotionally maxed out in Thursday’s 82-78 home over Duke.</p><p xmlns="">But Pinson scored nine of his 16 points after Notre Dame (15-11, 5-8) had cut UNC’s lead to 58-57 with 9:38 left in the second half. Pinson also had with 10 rebounds and five assists for the Heels, who won their fourth straight ACC game.</p><p xmlns="">Senior guard Joel Berry added 21 points and Cam Johnson had 13, including two on a crowd-pleasing dunk over Notre Dame guard Rex Pflueger during a game-turning 26-6 run.</p><p xmlns="">The Tar Heels led 56-46 with 13 minutes left and then hit a wall. Forwards Martinas Geben (18 points) and John Mooney (18 points) were able to exploit UNC’s defense inside and out. Mooney hit six 3-pointers and T.J. Gibbs followed up Mooney’s sixth with a 3 that cut UNC’s lead down to 58-57.</p><p xmlns="">But Pinson responded and kept UNC’s letdown from turning into a loss. Pinson followed Johnson’s dunk with a three-point play and then a circus layup to stretch UNC’s margin to 72-63.</p><p xmlns="">UNC overcame a sluggish scoring effort by junior forward Luke Maye. Maye had a career-high 33 points in Saturday’s win at N.C. State but was held to eight on Monday.</p><p xmlns="">———</p><p xmlns="">©2018 The News &amp; Observer (Raleigh, N.C.)</p><p xmlns="">Visit The News &amp; Observer (Raleigh, N.C.) at www.newsobserver.com</p><p xmlns="">Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.</p></xmlText><xmlFormatRef><keyVal xmlns="">XHTML</keyVal></xmlFormatRef></story></xml></log>
