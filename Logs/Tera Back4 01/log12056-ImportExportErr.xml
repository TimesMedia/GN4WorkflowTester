If the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration lets GM out of the recalls, the company says it could save $1 billion and avoid recalling up to 6.8 million older full-size pickup trucks and SUVs.</p><p xmlns="">Takata inflators can explode with too much force and hurl shrapnel. At least 22 people have been killed worldwide and more than 180 injured.</p><p xmlns="">GM says inflators in its trucks are unique, with bigger vents and stronger steel end caps. It says no inflators have blown apart on roads or in extensive lab tests.</p></xmlText><xmlFormatRef><keyVal xmlns="">XHTML</keyVal></xmlFormatRef></story></xml></log>
