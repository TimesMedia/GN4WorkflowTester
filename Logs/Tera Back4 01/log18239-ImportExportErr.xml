(TNS)</bycr></p><p xmlns="">SYRACUSE, N.Y. — Syracuse kept coming back. Joel Berry kept coming up with answers.</p><p xmlns="">Berry’s steal and layup with 1:36 left helped No. 10 North Carolina escape with a 78-74 win at Syracuse on Wednesday night.</p><p xmlns="">It’s the sixth straight win for UNC (22-7, 11-5 ACC) since a three-game losing streak at the end of January and the Tar Heels’ sixth straight win over Syracuse (18-10, 7-8).</p><p xmlns="">The Orange trailed by as many as 12 in the second half but, with 26 points from sophomore guard Tyus Battle, was able to tie the score at 74.</p><p xmlns="">After an empty possession, UNC coach Roy Williams called timeout with 2:20 left to settle his team down.</p><p xmlns="">Berry (18 points) missed a 3-pointer on that possession but responded on Syracuse’s next possession when he stole the ball from forward Pascal Chukwu and raced to the other end of the floor for a layup.</p><p xmlns="">The second-half rally, led by Battle and Frank Howard (23 points), nearly offset a career game from UNC senior Theo Pinson.</p><p xmlns="">The versatile wing scored a career-high 23 points and added seven assists. Pinson’s 3-pointer, at 4:51, put UNC up 74-66 but the Orange kept coming.</p><p xmlns="">Syracuse had two chances in the final 70 seconds to either take the lead or tie the game but Battle missed a jumper and then Howard missed a 3 with 17 seconds left.</p><p xmlns="">Berry was fouled with 12.5 seconds left and made both free throws to ice the game.</p><p xmlns="">The Tar Heels carved up the Orange’s signature 2-3 zone with sharp interior passes to build its double-digit lead.</p><p xmlns="">The soft spot of Jim Boeheim’s zone, which is more of a quarter-court trap, is the foul line and Williams knows it. Two years ago, All-American forward Brice Johnson — a traditional big in Williams’ offense — had a career-high eight assists in an 84-73 win by the Tar Heels here.</p><p xmlns="">It was Pinson’s turn on Wednesday night. The unconventional forward worked out of the high post and UNC’s ball movement was superb. The Tar Heels had 25 assists on 29 field goals, including 14 of 16 in the first half.</p><p xmlns="">Boeheim, of course, has a famous win over Williams — in the 2003 national title game when Williams was at Kansas — and Syracuse won the first ACC game between the two schools in 2014 in this building but it has been all UNC ever since.</p><p xmlns="">Berry and Pinson made sure that streak continued on Wednesday.</p><p xmlns="">———</p><p xmlns="">©2018 The News &amp; Observer (Raleigh, N.C.)</p><p xmlns="">Visit The News &amp; Observer (Raleigh, N.C.) at www.newsobserver.com</p><p xmlns="">Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.</p><p xmlns="">_____</p><p xmlns="">Topics: t000008058,t000008056,t000003183,g000065556,g000362661,g000219290,g000066164</p></xmlText><xmlFormatRef><keyVal xmlns="">XHTML</keyVal></xmlFormatRef></story></xml></log>
