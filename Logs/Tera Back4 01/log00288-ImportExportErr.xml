We lost a number of our near and dear ones," Muhammad Azam told AFP at a funeral for a neighbour. "Our loved ones will never come back."</p><p>The 5.2 magnitude quake was not as strong as several that have struck the area over the years, but the epicentre was very shallow -- which generally causes more damage. </p><p>Near Mirpur, a well-developed city known for its palatial residences, many roads were destroyed, while bridges, mobile phone towers and electricity poles were also badly damaged.</p><p>The village of Jatlan on the outskirts of Mirpur appeared to be one of the worst affected.</p><p>There, residents combed through debris and assessed the damage inflicted on their homes, with large cracks defacing walls in the houses that still stood, and brick fences reduced to rubble.   </p><p>"I lost my house. I lost everything," said Abdullah Khan, whose three-bedroom home was flattened. </p><p>The Pakistan military continued to lead search and rescue operations.</p><p>Lieutenant General Mohammad Afzal of the National Disaster Management Agency (NDMA) said 25 people had been confirmed killed so far -- 24 in Mirpur and one in the nearby city of Jhelum.</p><p>"Some 350 people were wounded, 80 of them critically," he told a press conference Wednesday.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Teams of doctors had arrived in the area, while the NDMA had also sent hundreds of tents, bottles of water and food rations. </p><p>Afzal said 450 houses had been damaged -- 136 of them "completely" -- while 14 kilometres (nine miles) of road was "badly affected". Engineers were rushing to make repairs.  </p><p>He said the ambassadors of three countries had offered assistance, but that Pakistani authorities had the matter under control. </p><p>Information minister Firdous Ashiq Awan gave a higher injury toll of 500, and told reporters that survivors would be offered compensation.  </p><p>Mirpur's deputy commissioner, Qaiser Aurangzeb, said rescuers had also reached one of the more remote villages in the area and were assessing the damage caused by the quake.</p><p>Rain continued to inundate the district after overnight showers turned already damaged roads into muddy thoroughfares where livestock roamed freely.</p><p>In Mirpur, life was quickly returning to normal and most of the well-built structures in the city showed little sign of damage.</p><p>Mirpur owes its prosperity to thousands of former residents who migrated to Britain in the 1960s, but retained their links to the area -- repatriating money to buy land and build palatial homes. Many of its 450,000 residents are dual British-Pakistan nationals.</p><p>Local hospitals in the city swelled, however, with many patients suffering from multiple fractures.</p><p>"I was going to see a friend when the entire area shook with a bang and a huge wall crumbled over me. When I regained my senses I found myself here in this bed," Ali Badshah, a fifth-grade student, told AFP from a hospital in Mirpur, where he was being treated for a broken leg. </p><p>The quake sent people in Lahore and Islamabad running into the streets, while tremors were also felt as far as New Delhi. </p><p>The Press Trust of India reported that panicking people rushed out of their homes and offices in Rajasthan, Punjab, and Haryana.</p><p>Pakistan straddles part of the boundary where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates meet, making the country susceptible to earthquakes.</p><p>The country was hit by a 7.6-magnitude quake in 2005 that killed more than 73,000 people and left about 3.5 million homeless, mainly in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir.</p><p>zz-jaf-sjd-ds/st/fox</p><p class="credit">AFP</p></xmlText><xmlFormatRef><keyVal>XHTML</keyVal></xmlFormatRef></story></xml></log>
