World Rugby have also praised the work of the High Performance Centre built near Montevideo in 2013.</p><p>Uruguay know they will have to be patient but wins like Wednesday's will go a long way to developing the game back home.</p><p>"All these wonderful players we have, we (still) do not have experience in international matches," said Gaminara, who still plays in Uruguay.</p><p>"But we have now proved that we can beat such a big team."</p><p>Uruguay now have four days to prepare for a physical test against Georgia.</p><p>"We participated at the last World Cup and have been developing and working hard, so this victory is a big step forward," added Meneses.</p><p>"All we have been thinking about for the last four years is beating Fiji and Georgia."
