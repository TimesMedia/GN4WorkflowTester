The top of the leaderboard was of little consequence on this day.</p><p xmlns="">Father and son were stalking Tiger, who made the cut by a stroke and was bogeying his second hole of the day to fall to even par as Shabi and Nicholas Asghar walked his way.</p><p xmlns="">“I like Michael Jordan, I like to watch Tiger Woods,” Shabi Asghar said. “I’m a sports fan.”</p><p xmlns="">We are in an unprecedented period on the PGA Tour wherein the talent pool has swollen to nearly the size of the ocean that roils below the fairways at Torrey Pines.</p><p xmlns="">On Saturday, though, the Tour was in a Tiger warp.</p><p xmlns="">“It’s like going back to the future,” Shabi Asghar said. “It’s pretty awesome to be able to see it. Michael Jordan could never come back and play with the kids. Tiger Woods can play with Rickie Fowler and Jordan Spieth. And he can play at their level.”</p><p xmlns="">The last sentence was said as a matter of fact, even though we just don’t know if it is true.</p><p xmlns="">And that is the point — that so many seem to want it so badly.</p><p xmlns="">The bulk of the attention Saturday on the seaside course at Torrey Pines was on a humbled hero who won his last tournament in 2013. And that made the real story what was going on outside the ropes.</p><p xmlns="">As Woods sprayed tee shots into trees and even off one fan’s leg, sent iron shots from the rough into bunkers and somehow willed putts into the hole in short enough order that he shot a 2-under 70 to get to 3-under for the tournament, the thousands who followed him were willing right along with him.</p><p xmlns="">Mike Silas and his four friends were watching Woods tee off on the 15th and plotting their next move to get ahead of the crowds to get their next good glimpse of the swing they missed seeing.</p><p xmlns="">Why?</p><p xmlns="">“Because we grew up the biggest Tiger Woods fans, and this is the first time he’s qualified for the weekend in 29 months,” Silas said.</p><p xmlns="">When Woods was down — seeking treatment for sex addiction once, twice entering rehab for addition to pain medication and having four back surgeries — golf got great without him.</p><p xmlns="">Those who still cared got to know Justin Rose and Jon Rahm and Jason Day and dozens of others who are winning every other week and are a threat at majors.</p><p xmlns="">“That was good,” Mike Silas said. “But Tiger takes it to another level.”</p><p xmlns="">The Union-Tribune received a number of emails complaining about Woods being so prominent in Saturday’s sports section.</p><p xmlns="">“NO ONE gives a rip about Tiger Woods and what he does,” read one missive sent to our Tod Leonard. “Certainly the ‘Golf World’ did not get its wish by this serial adulterer making the cut at Torrey Pines. The wish is rather that he would simply go away and never be heard from again. In my humble opinion.”</p><p xmlns="">Either that person has not been at Torrey Pines this week or was following the leaders and wondered why the Farmers attendance was down so sharply.</p><p xmlns="">Leader Alex Noren is not why parking at Torrey is sold out for the final round. Neither are Rahm or Rose, who are in contention. No, Uber and Lyft drivers have Tiger to thank for their spiked fares Sunday.</p><p xmlns="">Cheers for Woods were somewhat muted in the wake of his extramarital sex scandal in 2009, back when he was still the World’s No.1 ranked golfer. Not now. This is America. We might tire of heroes, even turn on them quickly. But, dang, we love a good comeback story.</p><p xmlns="">Combine the seeking of redemption with the seeking of regained dominance? God help the course marshals if this guy is ever in contention on a Sunday again.</p><p xmlns="">Walking out on the back nine to meet up with Woods’ threesome was a little like making the afternoon commute up Interstate 15. Mira Mesa, and it’s wide open. Rancho Bernardo, slowing down. Escondido, stopped.</p><p xmlns="">I actually pulled up along the 13th and waited for the traffic to come to me.</p><p xmlns="">In the distance, after Tiger had holed a birdie on 12, the throng went running to line the adjacent fairway. After a rare tee shot that ended up in short grass, Woods appeared over the hill, and the folks circling the green cheered.</p><p xmlns="">Standing along the ropes, Josh Estill said, “It’s good to see him back.”</p><p xmlns="">To that, Kyle Doan added, “It’s good to see him Saturday.”</p><p xmlns="">This tournament — where Woods won in 1999, 2003, every year from ’05 to ’08 and ’13 — is Woods’ first Tour event since he played here last January. This is the first time he’s made a cut since the Wyndham Championship in August 2015.</p><p xmlns="">What accompanied him Saturday was perhaps not the Tiger roars of the 2008 U.S. Open he won at Torrey. But it was far louder than anything heard anywhere else on this course in 2018.</p><p xmlns="">All along the way:</p><p xmlns="">“Let’s go Tiger.”</p><p xmlns="">“Welcome back, Tiger.”</p><p xmlns="">“You’re the man, Tiger.”</p><p xmlns="">“Look at that body.”</p><p xmlns="">His tee shot on 15 sailed left between two big trees. The crowd around him was 10 deep as he pondered his best course.</p><p xmlns="">When he shifted left to attempt a hard cut after initially pondering a punch out right to the fairway, there was the type of intensely expectant murmur usually only heard when someone is attempting to perform a tracheotomy with a silly straw and half a stick of spearmint gum.</p><p xmlns="">When the ball shot from his club face, the roar would not have been louder had he split the ball in two and both halves were headed dead straight for the flag. (To be sure, his ball was in one piece and lying in the greenside bunker when he next stood over it.)</p><p xmlns="">It is almost impossible to quantify the mass of humanity that awaited him around the 16th tee box.</p><p xmlns="">Following Woods for several holes felt like being paparazzi at LAX when Kim Kardashian gets off a flight from Paris. (If Kim had once won an Academy Award, a Grammy, an Emmy and a Pulitzer Prize for poetry.)</p><p xmlns="">“This is amazing how many people there are,” Andy North, a two-time U.S. Open champion who is now an analyst for ESPN. “This is great.”</p><p xmlns="">Great for tournament organizers. Maybe great for the PGA Tour.</p><p xmlns="">As for whether Tiger is great again, we clearly hope so.</p><p xmlns="">———</p><p xmlns="">©2018 The San Diego Union-Tribune</p><p xmlns="">Visit The San Diego Union-Tribune at www.sandiegouniontribune.com</p><p xmlns="">Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.</p></xmlText><xmlFormatRef><keyVal xmlns="">XHTML</keyVal></xmlFormatRef></story></xml></log>
