Taiwan has denounced China for luring its allies with promises of easy loans.</p><p>In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said cooperation was warmly welcomed and had brought the Pacific island nations real benefits.</p><p>"Anyone who understands the situation and is not prejudiced can see this very clearly," he told a daily news briefing, when asked about Heine's criticism of China's role.</p><p>Self-ruled Taiwan now has formal relations with only 15 countries, many of them small, less developed nations in Central America and the Pacific, including Belize and Nauru.</p><p>Seven countries have dropped Taiwan as a diplomatic ally since 2016, when Tsai took office. So the show of support from the Marshall Islands will provide some relief for her ahead of presidential elections in January.</p><p>Last week parliament in the tiny South Pacific country of Tuvalu elected a new prime minister, making a change that analysts say could give China a chance to further undermine Taiwan in a region that has been a pillar of support.</p><p>Having retained his seat at a general election earlier this month, Tuvalu's pro-Taiwan leader Enele Sopoaga had been expected to keep the premiership, but the 16-person parliament instead selected Kausea Natano.</p><p>Taiwan's embassy in Tuvalu said that its ambassador there, Marc Su, met Natano and Foreign Minister Simon Kofe on Tuesday, having met with all members of the new Cabinet late last week.</p><p>It did not provide details of their conversations.
