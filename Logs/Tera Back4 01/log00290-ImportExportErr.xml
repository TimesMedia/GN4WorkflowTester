Bloomberg News reported Tuesday that Nintendo sold 114,192 units of the Switch Lite between Sept. 20-22, according to digital entertainment researcher Media Create. That’s less than half the 300,000 units forecast by Citigroup.</p><p>“The initial impression is negative,” Citi analysts Minami Munakata and Yui Shoji said in a research note. “Casual gamers that could be drawn to the new console are unlikely to rush to buy the console immediately after its launch.”</p><p>There’s More to Nintendo’s Game Than Gadget Sales: Tim Culpan</p><p>The Kyoto-based company, known for iconic characters like Mario and Zelda, has been experimenting with new hardware and software products as the rising popularity of smartphones has hit the traditional market for gamers playing on consoles. A smartphone version of the company’s popular Mario Kart franchise will launch today, another debut that will be closely tracked by investors.</p><p>Even with today’s share drop, Nintendo’s stock is up almost 40% this year on expectations that a strong game lineup will drive hardware sales. The launch slate includes a new installment in the Zelda saga, Luigi’s Mansion and two Pokemon games. The company also released details of its new ‘Ring Fit Adventure’ fitness game and its accompanying Ring-Con and Leg Strap accessories that will go on sale next month.</p><p>Mario Kart Tour is scheduled to launch around 5 p.m. Tokyo time on Wednesday. Nintendo earlier this summer conducted a closed beta for the game on Android. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is the company’s most popular game on the Switch with almost 18 million units sold. The franchise also topped software rankings for the predecessor Wii U and handheld Nintendo 3DS.</p><p>To contact the reporters on this story: Pavel Alpeyev in Tokyo at palpeyev@bloomberg.net;Yuki Furukawa in Tokyo at yfurukawa13@bloomberg.net</p><p>To contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, Peter Elstrom</p><p>For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com</p><p>©2019 Bloomberg L.P.</p></xmlText><xmlFormatRef><keyVal>XHTML</keyVal></xmlFormatRef></story></xml></log>
