Miami spoiled UNC’s Senior Night with a 91-88 win over the ninth-ranked Tar Heels at the Smith Center.</p><p xmlns="">Miami senior Ja’Quan Newton hit a long 3-pointer at the buzzer to give the Hurricanes (21-8, 10-7 ACC) the dramatic win. UNC (22-8, 11-6 ACC) will still be the No. 2 seed in the ACC tournament with a win at Duke on Saturday.</p><p xmlns="">So, in that sense, Tuesday’s game didn’t matter. Except it was the last hurrah at the Smith Center for Berry and Pinson.</p><p xmlns="">Newton scored the final nine points for Miami to hold off a furious UNC rally. Berry led all scorers with a career-high 31 points, including his last 3 with 4.1 seconds left to tie the game at 88.</p><p xmlns="">The Tar Heels trailed by as many as 16 in the second half and by 10 with 4:57 left but Berry kept scrapping and clawing, determined not end his home career with a loss. Newton just had one last answer.</p><p xmlns="">———</p><p xmlns="">©2018 The News &amp; Observer (Raleigh, N.C.)</p><p xmlns="">Visit The News &amp; Observer (Raleigh, N.C.) at www.newsobserver.com</p><p xmlns="">Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.</p><p xmlns="">_____</p><p xmlns="">Topics: t000008058,t000008056,t000003183,g000065577,g000220201,g000362661,g000066164</p></xmlText><xmlFormatRef><keyVal xmlns="">XHTML</keyVal></xmlFormatRef></story></xml></log>
