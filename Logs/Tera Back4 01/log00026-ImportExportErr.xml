When Daniel Hudson retired the Phillies in the ninth for his second save of the day, the Nationals stayed on the field. Minutes later, the Pittsburgh Pirates defeated the Chicago Cubs 9-2, and Washington was celebrating being back in the playoffs after a one-year absence.</p><p>Yan Gomes also homered for the Nationals, who lead the Milwaukee Brewers by one game for home-field advantage in the wild-card game.</p><p>Turner had three hits in the first game, a 4-1 Washington win. The Phillies were eliminated from playoff contention with the defeat in the opener.</p><p>Astros 3, Mariners 0</p><p>Gerrit Cole pitched seven shutout innings on a historic night as Houston continued its mastery of host Seattle and moved 1 1/2 games ahead of the New York Yankees in the race for the best record in the majors and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs.</p><p>Cole (19-5) allowed only two hits and struck out 14 without issuing a walk. He matched his career high for victories set in 2015 with Pittsburgh and surpassed the Astros' franchise record for single-season strikeouts (313), set by J.R. Richard in 1978. Cole now has a major-league-leading 316 strikeouts.</p><p>Alex Bregman hit his 40th home run of the season for the Astros, who are 17-1 against Seattle this season. Ryan Pressly struck out three in the eighth inning, and Roberto Osuna pitched the ninth for his 37th save.</p><p>Dodgers 6, Padres 3</p><p>Max Muncy hit the first grand slam of his career, and eight Los Angeles pitchers -- starting with Rich Hill -- yielded just three runs on five hits as the visiting Dodgers defeated San Diego.</p><p>With the victory, the Dodgers are now assured of finishing the regular season with the best overall record in the National League.</p><p>Los Angeles took a 5-0 lead before San Diego scored three times in the fifth.

It was Choi's 18th homer and second career walk-off homer.</p><p>Yankees third baseman Gio Urshela exited in the seventh after being hit in the left hand an inning earlier. He remained in the game to run the bases after being hit, and then played a half-inning on defense at third before being substituted.</p><p>Angels 3, A's 2</p><p>Albert Pujols' fifth-inning sacrifice fly snapped a tie and helped lift Los Angeles to a win over Oakland in Anaheim, Calif.</p><p>Dillon Peters (4-3) tossed five innings of two-run ball, getting help from four relievers who combined to shut out the A's over the final four innings. Hansel Robles pitched the ninth for his 23rd save.</p><p>Oakland has lost two in a row for the first time since Aug. 31-Sept. 1. The Athletics' lead in the three-team race for the two American League wild cards was reduced to just a half-game over the Rays and one game over the Indians.</p><p>Brewers 4, Reds 2</p><p>Ryan Braun belted a solo homer among his two hits as visiting Milwaukee inched closer to a postseason berth with a victory over Cincinnati.</p><p>Yasmani Grandal ripped an RBI double and rookie Keston Hiura added a sacrifice fly in a two-run third inning for the Brewers, who won for the 16th time in their past 18 contests and moved five games ahead of the Chicago Cubs for the final National League wild-card spot.</p><p>Josh Hader struck out Kyle Farmer with runners on second and third base in the ninth to secure his 36th save of the season.

He was removed after 93 pitches due to hamstring tightness. Taylor Rogers got the last three outs for his 29th save.</p><p>Indians 11, White Sox 0</p><p>Jose Ramirez belted a grand slam and a three-run home run in his return to the lineup from injury and Mike Clevinger pitched seven shutout innings for visiting Cleveland. The Indians remained one-half game behind the Tampa Bay Rays for the second American League wild-card spot.</p><p>Ramirez went 2-for-3 with seven RBIs as Cleveland outhit Chicago 12-6. Yasiel Puig had three hits, while Roberto Perez and Mike Freeman had two apiece.</p><p>Clevinger improved to 13-3 while earning his first win against the White Sox this season, scattering five hits, one walk and 10 strikeouts in seven innings.

Julio Teheran (10-11) lasted just 2 1/3 innings, allowing six hits and six runs with one walk and one strikeout for Atlanta.</p><p>Mets 5, Marlins 4 (11 innings)</p><p>Brandon Nimmo drew a bases-loaded walk in the 11th inning as New York mounted a late comeback and stayed alive in the National League wild-card race with a win over visiting Miami.</p><p>Had the Mets lost, they would have been eliminated by virtue of their defeat and wins earlier in the day by Washington and Milwaukee. New York will be eliminated from contention with one more loss or one more win by the Brewers.</p><p>The Mets trailed 4-0 entering the seventh inning, when J.D. Davis hit a leadoff double and Michael Conforto followed with a two-run homer. Davis and Conforto teamed up again in the ninth, when Davis led off with a single against Jose Urena and Conforto followed with another homer, to almost the exact same spot in right-center field.</p><p>Red Sox 12, Rangers 10</p><p>J.D. Martinez had two hits and three RBIs to back a laboring Eduardo Rodriguez in his 19th win as Boston held off Texas at Arlington, Texas.</p><p>Xander Bogaerts and Jackie Bradley Jr. each drove in a pair for the Red Sox.
