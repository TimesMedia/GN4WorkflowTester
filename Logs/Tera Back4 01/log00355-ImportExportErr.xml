Bloomberg reported earlier this month the carmaker might return soon to Europe’s bond market, citing four people familiar with the matter.</p><p>The new financing is expected to bolster Aston Martin’s liquidity until it starts generating cash from a new SUV model -- the DBX -- in 2020. The U.K. carmaker generated about 900,000 pounds ($1.1 million) of cash from operations in the first half of the year, the lowest since it started to disclose earnings, data compiled by Bloomberg show.</p><p>The Gaydon-based manufacturer has blamed its ailing sales on ongoing Brexit uncertainty and a wider fallout in the auto industry this year. Its equity has slumped since the company went public at 19 pounds a share almost a year ago.</p><p>Aston Martin avoided a public debt offering in April and instead opted to privately place $190 million of bonds. That issuance would allow the company “to weather the difficult industry conditions,” S&amp;P Global Ratings said at the time.</p><p>To contact the reporter on this story: Thomas Mulier in Geneva at tmulier@bloomberg.net</p><p>To contact the editors responsible for this story: Eric Pfanner at epfanner1@bloomberg.net, Tara Patel, Andrew Noël</p><p>For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com</p><p>©2019 Bloomberg L.P.</p></xmlText><xmlFormatRef><keyVal>XHTML</keyVal></xmlFormatRef></story></xml></log>
