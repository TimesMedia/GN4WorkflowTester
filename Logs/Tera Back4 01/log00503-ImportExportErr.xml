The United Nations has said 7.1 million people in the region need assistance in one of the world's worst humanitarian crises.</p><p>"Mercy Corps is suspending operations in Borno and Yobe States, Nigeria, following the closure of four of our field offices by the Nigerian military," said Amy Fairbairn, its head of media and communications, in a statement.</p><p>"We have not yet received an official reason from the Nigerian authorities for the closure and we are seeking to work with them to resolve this as soon as possible," said Fairbairn.</p><p>Borno is the birthplace of the insurgency and the state worst hit, with attacks intensifying over the last year primarily carried out by a Boko Haram splinter faction allied to Islamic State that broke away in 2016. Yobe state has also been badly hit by the conflict.</p><p>The statement added that Mercy Corps' work in other parts of Nigeria would continue uninterrupted.</p><p>Two Nigerian military spokesmen did not immediately respond to phone calls and text messages seeking comment on the reason for the closure of Mercy Corps offices.</p><p>The closures coincide with a change in the military's approach to the insurgency.</p><p>Nigerian soldiers have left many towns in the region under a new strategy of withdrawing to "super camps" that can be more easily defended against insurgents. Some security experts have expressed concerns that the areas vacated are being filled by insurgents, leaving civilians vulnerable.</p><p>A few days after forcing the closure of Action Against Hunger offices last week, the army said it will require anyone moving through three northeastern states to carry identification cards in an effort to root out Islamists.</p><p>(Reporting by Alexis Akwagyiram and Maiduguri Newsroom, Editing by William Maclean)</p></xmlText><xmlFormatRef><keyVal>XHTML</keyVal></xmlFormatRef></story></xml></log>
