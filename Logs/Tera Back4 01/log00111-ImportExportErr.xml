Some were leased through our parent company and subleased to us, others were the opposite."</p><p>It was not immediately clear how the situation would be resolved.</p><p>"The owners of the planes are right now looking into who's got what, and that is why some planes are on the ground until this is resolved," said Nedergaard.</p><p>"We're in dialogue with all parties involved as we speak and hope it will be resolved during the morning."</p><p>Among the disruptions, a flight from Palma de Mallorca to Helsinki was cancelled on Tuesday, according to Finnish airport operator Finavia, while a flight from Helsinki to Palma de Mallorca due to leave at 1740 local time eventually flew at 2347. A flight from Finland to Croatia was also cancelled early on Wednesday, just before boarding was about to begin.</p><p>Thomas Cook's Nordic business said on Monday it would continue to operate as it is a separate legal entity from its parent, and it was looking for new owners.</p><p>The British parent's German arm, Condor, similarly remains in business. On Tuesday, the German government said it would guarantee a 380 million euro ($418 million) bridging loan to keep it flying.</p><p>The Nordic business consists of two legal entities, Thomas Cook Northern Europe and Thomas Cook Scandinavian Airlines, and is also known as Ving Group. The business operates under several brands: Ving in Norway, Spies in Denmark, Tjareborg in Finland, as well as Ving and Globetrotter in Sweden.</p><p>Tjareborg said in a statement that "operations continue normally from Tuesday September 24 onwards. Business as usual".</p><p>Hundreds of thousands of holidaymakers were stranded by the collapse of London-based Thomas Cook, the world's oldest travel firm.</p><p>Close to 35,000 holidaymakers from the Nordics were travelling with the company at the time of the announcement.</p><p>($1 = 0.9093 euros) (Additional reporting by Tommy Lund in Gdansk; Writing by Gwladys Fouche in Oslo; Editing by Mark Potter)</p></xmlText><xmlFormatRef><keyVal>XHTML</keyVal></xmlFormatRef></story></xml></log>
