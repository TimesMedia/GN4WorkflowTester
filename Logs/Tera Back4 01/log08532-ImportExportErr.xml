He could also smell body odor and what was described as the pungent smell of a soap commonly used in Mexico.</p><p xmlns="">The truck’s driver, a U.S. citizen who had been placed in the CHP car, said the truck was his and gave permission to search.</p><p xmlns="">When the agent opened the rear doors, he found dozens of people standing inside, sweating excessively, the complaint states.</p><p xmlns="">In an interview with authorities, the driver, Shawn Lee Seiler, admitted to being a human smuggler who was expecting to transport 50 people that evening, the complaint says. He said he was surprised to learn there were 77 inside.</p><p xmlns="">He told investigators he was to be paid $100 for each unauthorized immigrant he transported.</p><p xmlns="">Seiler was arrested on a charge of transporting unauthorized immigrants for financial gain.</p><p xmlns="">Criminal charges were also lodged against two of the unauthorized immigrants after records checks found they had previous deportations — one on Jan. 9 through San Ysidro and one on May 14, 2015, through El Paso, Texas.</p><p xmlns="">The remaining people in the group are being held as material witnesses in the smuggling case.</p><p xmlns="">———</p><p xmlns="">©2018 The San Diego Union-Tribune</p><p xmlns="">Visit The San Diego Union-Tribune at www.sandiegouniontribune.com</p><p xmlns="">Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.</p><p xmlns="">—————</p><p xmlns="">PHOTO (for help with images, contact 312-222-4194):IMMIGRATION-BORDERPATROL-BUS</p><p xmlns="">_____</p><p xmlns="">Topics: c000212762,g000362661,g000065562,g000066164</p></xmlText><xmlFormatRef><keyVal xmlns="">XHTML</keyVal></xmlFormatRef></story></xml></log>
