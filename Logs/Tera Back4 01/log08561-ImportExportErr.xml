State.</p><p xmlns="">The Tar Heels lost one player to a suspension, another to an injury and a third straight ACC game on Tuesday.</p><p xmlns="">No. 20 Clemson poured in 3-pointers like salt in an open wound in the first half and then held on for an 82-78 win over the 19th-ranked Tar Heels.</p><p xmlns="">Junior guard Marcquise Reed made a 3-pointer with 1:41 left to break a 74-74 tie and then fed junior forward Elijah Thomas for a layup and a 79-74 lead with 27.6 seconds left.</p><p xmlns="">Shelton Mitchell put the game away at the free-throw line in the final 16 seconds for the Tigers (18-4, 7-3 ACC).</p><p xmlns="">Cam Johnson had a career-high 32 points to lead a furious comeback for UNC (16-7, 5-5), which trailed by 16 at the half. Senior guard Joel Berry added 27 points but no other UNC player finished in double figures.</p><p xmlns="">The Tar Heels are running out of available scholarship players. A nine-hour flurry of bad news for UNC started with the suspension of freshman guard Jalek Felton before the game and continued with a shoulder injury to senior forward Theo Pinson just 1 minute and 32 seconds into the game.</p><p xmlns="">The Tigers just added to the misery by hitting 15 3-pointers and breaking a 10-game losing streak to the Tar Heels.</p><p xmlns="">It is the first time since the 2013-14 season UNC has lost three straight games. The Heels are just 1-4 on the road in league play.</p><p xmlns="">The Heels expected to be without Felton, a reserve who was suspended indefinitely by the university and is being investigated for a misconduct case, but not Pinson.</p><p xmlns="">The 6-foot-6 senior, who has started every game, fell hard to the floor after he jumped up for a rebound at 18:28 in the first half. Pinson was fouled in the air by Clemson forward David Skara and then braced for his fall and landed awkwardly.</p><p xmlns="">He favored his left arm as he walked into the visiting locker room for treatment. Pinson was unable to return.</p><p xmlns="">UNC’s defense has struggled to defend the 3-point line this season with Pinson and it wasn’t any better on Tuesday.</p><p xmlns="">The Wolfpack went 15 of 30 in Saturday’s 95-91 overtime win and the Tigers picked up where they left off with 10 3s, on 19 attempts, in the first half.</p><p xmlns="">Clemson, playing its third game without senior forward Donte Grantham, who is out for the season with a knee injury, got 20 points from Reed and 17 points from senior guard Gabe DeVoe for its first win over UNC since 2010.</p><p xmlns="">———</p><p xmlns="">©2018 The News &amp; Observer (Raleigh, N.C.)</p><p xmlns="">Visit The News &amp; Observer (Raleigh, N.C.) at www.newsobserver.com</p><p xmlns="">Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.</p><p xmlns="">_____</p><p xmlns="">Topics: g000225474,g000362661,g000065792,g000066164</p></xmlText><xmlFormatRef><keyVal xmlns="">XHTML</keyVal></xmlFormatRef></story></xml></log>
