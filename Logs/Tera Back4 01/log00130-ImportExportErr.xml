It had rallied Tuesday following Britain's Supreme Court ruling that Prime Minister Boris Johnson's suspension of parliament was "unlawful", providing a spark of hope that Brexit will be more orderly than previously feared.</p><p>"The ensuing British Pound rally was a bit underwhelming. It probably reflected the uncertainty of both Mr Johnson's tenure and the Brexit process with October the 31st looming," said OANDA's Halley.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Tokyo - Nikkei 225: DOWN 0.4 percent at 22,020.15 (CLOSE)</p><p>Hong Kong - Hang Seng: DOWN 1.2 percent at 25,955.92</p><p>Shanghai - Composite: DOWN 1.0 percent at 2,955.433 (CLOSE)</p><p>London - FTSE 100: DOWN 0.5 percent at 7,254.40</p><p>Euro/dollar: DOWN at $1.0997 from $1.1002</p><p>Pound/dollar: DOWN at $1.2445 from $1.2471</p><p>Euro/pound: UP at 88.416 from 88.24 pence</p><p>Dollar/yen: DOWN at 107.27 from 107.34</p><p>West Texas Intermediate: DOWN 0.9 percent at $56.77 per barrel</p><p>Brent North Sea crude: DOWN 1.1 percent at $62.39 per barrel </p><p>New York - Dow: DOWN 0.5 percent at 26,807.77 (close)</p><p>New York - S&amp;P 500: DOWN 0.8 percent at 2,966.60 (close)</p><p>New York - Nasdaq: DOWN 1.5 percent at 7,993.63 (close)</p><p>mtp/ind</p><p></p><p></p><p class="credit">AFP</p></xmlText><xmlFormatRef><keyVal>XHTML</keyVal></xmlFormatRef></story></xml></log>
