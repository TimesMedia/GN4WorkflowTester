She noted that Japan and Australia are already regulating crypto currency trading.</p><p xmlns="">"The EU, I understand, is moving very quickly in that direction and we think it's very important that similar regulations are happening in a number of other countries."</p><p xmlns="">Mandelker said she expects the issue to be discussed at meetings of the Group of 20 industrial economies. She recently told Congress that money laundering related to crypto currencies was "an area of high focus" for the Treasury Department.</p><p xmlns="">The U.S. started regulating such transactions in 2013 and considers traders and administrators of cryptocurrencies as "money transmitters" who are required to have strong anti-money laundering and other controls to prevent their use for illegal purposes, she said. It has imposed fines for violations of those regulations.</p><p xmlns="">Financial regulators in Asia have struggled to keep up with a regional boom in crypto currency investing.</p><p xmlns="">Japan, the world's largest market for bitcoin trading, is the only major advanced economy with a licensing system for digital currency intermediaries such as exchanges and payment providers. It moved to impose order on the gray zone for such dealings after a major trading platform, Mt. Gox, filed for bankruptcy protection, after masses of Bitcoin went missing, worth millions of dollars at that time.</p><p xmlns="">South Korea, which is also among the biggest bitcoin markets, has been looking for ways to regulate trading. In December its financial regulator ruled out using bitcoin for derivative products such as futures.</p><p xmlns="">The government said it was focusing on curbing tax evasion, money laundering and other criminal activities through crypto trading, requiring banks to identify who the investors are and where their money comes from and ending use of anonymous accounts for such dealings.</p></xmlText><xmlFormatRef><keyVal xmlns="">XHTML</keyVal></xmlFormatRef></story></xml></log>
