Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, asking to be recorded as voting no. The re-vote was needed because the full Senate did not take up Powell's nomination last year. The term of current Fed Chair Janet Yellen ends on Feb. 3.</p><p xmlns="">The committee also approved Fed board member Randal Quarles for a full 14-year term on the Fed board. He won approval last year for a shorter term. His nomination was also approved by voice vote, with Warren and Sens. Jack Reed, D-Rhode Island, and Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nevada, voting no.</p></xmlText><xmlFormatRef><keyVal xmlns="">XHTML</keyVal></xmlFormatRef></story></xml></log>
